# Simple-Neural-Network-Accelerator
Project where we conceptualized and designed a simple neural network accelerator, loosely based on the Eyeriss architecture, to accelerate the inference on a database of 10000 images. The trained model was made using KANN C libraries and the accelerator was synthesized as part of an SoC on an Altera FPGA.
